== 1 Overview

The Java Network Launching Protocol and API (JNLP) is a Web-centric
provisioning1 protocol and application environment for Web-deployed
Java applications. An application implementing this specification
is called a JNLP Client.

The main concepts in this specification are:

* A Web-centric application model with no installation phase,
which provides transparent and incremental updates, as well as
incremental downloading of an application. This is similar to the
model for HTML pages and Applets, but with greater control and
flexibility.
* A provisioning protocol that describes how to package an
application on a Web server, so it can be delivered across the Web
to a set of JNLP Clients. The key component in this provisioning
protocol is the JNLP file, which describes how to download and
launch an application.
* A standard execution environment for the application. The
execution environment includes both a safe environment where
access to the local disk and the network is restricted for
untrusted applications, and an unrestricted environment for
trusted applications. The restricted environment is similar to
the well-known Applet sandbox, but extended with additional APIs.

The main concepts are introduced in the following sections.

=== 1.1 Web-centric Application Model

A JNLP Client is an application or service that can launch
applications on a client system from resources hosted across the
network. It is not a general installation protocol for software
components. A high-level view of a JNLP Client is that it allows
an application to be run from a codebase that is accessed over
the Web, rather than from the local file system. It provides a
facility similar to what would happen if URLs were allowed in
the JRE's classpath, e.g., something that looks like this:

[source]
----
java -classpath http://www.mysite.com/app/MyApp.jar com.mysite.app.Main
----

The above example illustrates the basic functionality of a JNLP
Client. JNLP goes further than this, however. First, it provides
the ability to specify which version of the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) that the application requires. In the above
example, this amounts to choosing what java command to use. If
the requested JRE version is not available, a JRE can be
downloaded and installed automatically2. Second, it provides the ability
to specify native libraries as part of the application. Native libraries
are downloaded in JAR files. Thus, both signing and compression of the
libraries are supported. The native libraries are loaded into the running
process using the System.loadLibrary method.

All the resources that an JNLP Client needs to access in order to launch an
application are referenced with URLs. Conceptually, all of the application's
resources reside on the Web server. A JNLP Client is allowed and encouraged
to cache resources that are downloaded from the Web. This will improve
consecutive startup times, minimize network traffic, and enable offline operation.

This application model provides the following benefits:

* No installation phase: A JNLP Client simply needs to download and cache the
application's resources. The user does not need to be prompted about install
directories and the like.
* Transparent update: A JNLP Client can check the currently cached resources
against the versions hosted on the Web Server and transparently download newer versions.
* Incremental update: The JNLP Client only needs to download the resources that
have been changed when an application is updated. If only a few of the application's
resources have been modified, this can significantly reduce the amount of data that
needs to be downloaded when upgrading to a new version of an application. Furthermore,
incremental update of individual JAR files is also supported.
* Incremental download: A JNLP Client does not need to download an entire application
before it is launched. For example, for a spreadsheet application the downloading of the
graphing module could be postponed until first use. JNLP supports this model by allowing
the developer to specify what resources are needed before an application is launched
(eager), and what resources can be downloaded later (lazy). Furthermore, JNLP provides
an API so the developer can check if a resource is local or not (i.e., whether it needs
to be downloaded), and to request non-local resources to be downloaded.
* Offline support: A JNLP Client can launch an application offline if a sufficient set
of resources is cached locally. However, most applications deployed using JNLP are
expected to be Web-centric, i.e., they will typically connect back to a Web server
or database to retrieve their state. Hence, many applications will only work online.
The application developer specifies if offline operation is supported, and what
resources are needed locally to launch the application offline.

=== 1.2 Provisioning

==== 1.2.1 JNLP File

The core of the JNLP technology is the JNLP file. The JNLP file is an XML document.

Most commonly, a JNLP file will describe an application. A JNLP file of this kind is called
an application descriptor. It specifies the JAR files the application consists of, the JRE
it requires, optional packages that it depends on, its name and other display information,
its runtime parameters and system properties, etc. There is a one-to-one correspondence
between an application descriptor and an application.

A JNLP file does not contain any binary data itself. Instead it contains URLs that point to
all binary data, such as icons (in JPEG or GIF format), and binary code resources, such as
Java classes and native libraries (contained in JAR files). Figure 1 illustrates how an
application is described with JNLP files. The root JNLP file (application descriptor)
contains the basic information such as name and vendor, main class, and so forth. The JAR
files that constitute the "classpath" for the application are all referred to with URLs.

A JNLP file can also refer to other JNLP files, called extension descriptors. An extension
descriptor typically describes a component that must be used in order to run the application.
The resources described in the extension descriptor become part of the classpath for the
application. This allows common functionality to be factored out and described once. An
extension descriptor also provides the ability to run an installer that can install
platform-dependent resources before the application is launched, e.g., to install device
drivers.

.JNLP File and External Resources
image::TODO.png[]

The JNLP file is, in some sense, similar to a traditional executable format.
Traditionally, applications are delivered as binary platform-dependent files.
For example, on Windows, an application is delivered as a MyApp.exe executable.
The executable format is designed so the Windows operating system can load the
application and execute it. It also contains information about external dependencies,
such as MyApp.dll. This format is file-centric; all external references are references
to files on the local file system. In contrast, a JNLP file does not contain any binary
data itself, but instead contains URLs to where they can be obtained from. The JNLP
file format is Web-centric; the references to external resources are URLs, instead of
file names.

==== 1.2.2 Downloading Resources

The JNLP Client can download 3 different kind of resources: JAR files, images, and JNLP
files. All resources in a JNLP file are uniquely named using either a URL or a
`URL/version-id` pair. A typical application deployed using JNLP will consist of a set of
JAR files and a set of images3. JAR files, images, and JNLP files can be downloaded
using standard `HTTP GET` requests. For example: `http://www.mysite.com/app/MyApp.jar`

This basic download protocol works from a standard unmodified Web server. This leverages
existing Web server technology, which is important to achieve wide-spread use of a new
technology on the Internet.

To provide more control and better utilization of bandwidth, a version-based download
protocol is also supported. The version-based protocol is designed to:

* Allow several versions of an application to co-exist on a server at a given time. In
particular, this means that an application that is distributed as several JAR files can
be safely upgraded. A JNLP Client that is downloading JAR files right when a Web server
is being updated will never download JAR files that are a mix between two application
versions.
* Provide a unique URL for an application independent of its version. This allows a JNLP
Client to automatically detect and flush old versions out of the cache.
* Make it possible to incrementally update already-downloaded JAR files. This can
substantially minimize the download requirements for upgrading to a new version.
* Allow users to stick with a given version rather than always getting the latest
version from the Web server. For example, a JNLP Client can download an updated version
in the background, while the already-downloaded version is being used.
* The version-based protocol requires special support on the Web server. This support
can be provided using servlets, CGI-scripts, or by similar means.

The use of the version-based protocol is specified in the JNLP file on a per-resource
basis. Depending on the facilities the Web server offers (and possibly other factors),
the application developer can choose whether the version-based protocol should be used
or not.

=== 1.3 Application Environment

The application environment defines a common set of services and system settings that
an application launched with a JNLP Client can depend on. The core of this environment
is the JRE. In addition, this specification defines additional APIs and settings:

* Configured HTTP proxies.
* A secure execution environment that is similar to the well-known Applet sandbox.
* An API to securely and dynamically lookup and access features on the client platform,
such as instructing the default browser to display a URL.
* The application environment is defined as a set of required services that must be
implemented by all implementations that conform to this specification, and a set of
optional services that are not required to be implemented. Applications must check
for the presence of optional services and handle their absence sensibly.

=== 1.4 An Example

A helper application that implements the Java Network Launching protocol and API can be
associated with a Web browser. The helper application gets configured with the proper
HTTP proxy settings during installation, so they can be passed along to a launched
application4. Thus, the user does not have to specify proxy settings for each
application separately.

When a user clicks on a link pointing to a JNLP file, the browser will download the file
and invoke the helper application with the name of the downloaded file as an argument.
The helper application (i.e., the JNLP Client) interprets the JNLP file, which will direct
it to download and locally cache the JAR files and other resources for the particular
application. When all required JAR files have been downloaded, the application is launched.

A sample JNLP file, which is an XML document, is shown here:

[source, xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <jnlp codebase="http://www.mysite.com/app">
    <information>
      <title>Draw!</title>
      <vendor>My Web Company</vendor>
      <icon href="draw-icon.jpg"/>
      <offline-allowed/>
    </information>
    <resources>
      <java version="1.3+"/>
      <jar href="draw.jar"/>
    </resources>
  <application-desc main-class="com.mysite.Draw"/>
</jnlp>
----

The JNLP file describes how to launch the sample application, titled `Draw!`.
In the JNLP file, it is specified that the Java platform, version 1.3 or higher
is required to run this application, along with some general application information
that can be displayed to the user during the download phase.

=== 1.5 Comparing JNLP with Other Technologies

The JNLP technology is related to Java Applets. Java Applets are automatically
downloaded, cached, and launched by a Web browser without requiring any user interaction,
and Applets are executed in a secure sandbox environment by default. Applets are a core
part of the Java Platform, Standard Edition. Many of the technologies that are used by
JNLP are borrowed from the Applet technology, such as the downloading of code and the
secure sandbox.

Applications launched with JNLP need not run inside a browser window, but instead can
be separate applications that are run on separate Java Virtual Machines (JVMs). Thus,
applications launched with JNLP are typically more like traditional desktop applications
that are commonly distributed as shrink-wrapped software, e.g., on CDs.

JNLP is not a general installer for applications. It is particularly targeted to
Web-deployed Java Technology-based applications, i.e., applications that can be
downloaded from the Web and which store most of their state on the Web.

The JNLP protocol defines how Java Runtime Environments and optional packages can
be installed automatically. This will typically require the JREs and optional packages
to be bundled in a traditional installer.
